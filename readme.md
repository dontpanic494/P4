## Live URL

## Description
A recipe database created for and by users.

## Demo

## Details for teaching team
Fridge Buffet allows users to do all sorts of CRUDy things with recipes. They can view existing recipes, add new recipes, edit recipes, and even delete recipes. Users must be logged in to perform any alterations to the database, however non-logged-in users are able to view the existing recipes.

The Classic Grilled Cheese is sacred, and cannot be altered...so don’t bother trying.

## Outside code

## Comments
While I pivoted the focus of this project late in order to highlight CRUD functionality and authentication (the aim of this project), there are a few things I plan to do in the coming weeks/months.

First off, implementation of the laravel/socialite package to allow people to login with Facebook, Google, etc.

There’s also a really interesting recipe API that I’d like to test with the ORIGINAL aim of this project -> users would input the ingredients they have in their fridge, and the app would output possible recipes (hence the name Fridge Buffet).

All in all this was AWESOME, and I’ve very excited to continue to play with laravel over the summer!
